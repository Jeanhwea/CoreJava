# Core Java
Many developers, including original contributors of the project, prefer to more practical use of new knowledge rather than reading it in a textual form. This project attempts to illustrate core Java concepts in self-explanatory simple code examples. It particularly emphasizes on explaining new features and changes introduced in <b>Java 8</b>. 

# Contribution
Anyone who finds if there is missing or incorrect information in code examples is welcome to send pull requests. As we know, Rome wasn't built in a day.

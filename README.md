# Core Java 8
Many developers, including original contributors of this project, prefer to more practical use of new knowledge rather than reading it in a textual form. This project attempts to illustrate core Java concepts in self-explanatory simple code examples. It explains not only core APIs of Java, but also emphasizes on explaining new features and changes introduced in <b>Java 8</b>. 

# Java 8 features
Java 8 unveils many new features to its core APIs and brings many improvements in its existing core libraries. Below is a quick summary:

## Functional programming
Functional interfaces, lambda expressions, method references and more. Read [more](https://github.com/tugul/CoreJava/tree/master/lambdas)

## Stream API for Collections
``java.util.stream`` is newly introduced and it provides sequential or parallel operations on collections. Read [more](https://github.com/tugul/CoreJava/tree/master/streams)

## Default and static method in interface
Interface can have non-abstract concrete method if they are **default** or **static**. Read [more](https://github.com/tugul/CoreJava/tree/master/interfaces)

## NIO improvement
Non-blocking io API. Read [more](https://github.com/tugul/CoreJava/tree/master/nio2)

## Date Time API
Working with dates in older JDK was painful and developers often had to use external libraries. However, new API addresses the issues and provides clarity and flexibility to its core through ``java.time`` package: For example ``LocalDate``, ``LocalTime``, ``LocalDateTime``, ``ZonedDateTime``.

## Collection API improvement
New method ``forEach()`` and more . Read [more](https://github.com/tugul/CoreJava/tree/master/collections)

## Concurrency API Improvement
Read [more](https://github.com/tugul/CoreJava/tree/master/concurrency)

## Many more
Improvements on security, tools, deployment, networking, jdbc and many more. Refer to its official [announcement](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8-whats-new-2157071.html)
